# Altoclef [Anarchy Edition]

Plays block game.

Powered by Baritone.

A client side bot that can accomplish any Minecraft task that is relatively simple and can be split into smaller
tasks. "Relatively Simple" is a vague term, so check the list of current capabilities to see examples.

Became [the first bot to beat Minecraft fully autonomously](https://youtu.be/baAa6s8tahA) on May 24, 2021.

## How it works

Take a look at this [Guide from the wiki](https://github.com/gaucho-matrero/altoclef/wiki/1:-Documentation:-Big-Picture)
or this [Video explanation](https://youtu.be/q5OmcinQ2ck?t=387)

## Current capabilities, Examples:

- Obtain 400+ Items from a fresh survival world, like diamond armor, cake, and nether brick stairs
- Dodge mob projectiles and force field mobs away while accomplishing arbitrary tasks
- Collect + smelt food from animals, hay, & crops
- Receive commands from chat whispers via /msg. Whitelist + Blacklist configurable (hereby dubbed the Butler System).
  Here's
  a [Butler system demo video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1axVYYMJ5VjmVHaWlCifFHTwiXlFssOUc/view?usp=sharing)
- Simple config file that can be reloaded via command (check .minecraft directory)
- Beat the entire game on its own (no user input.)
- Print the entire bee movie script with signs in a straight line, automatically collecting signs + bridging materials
  along the way.
- Become the terminator: Run away from players while unarmed, gather diamond gear in secret, then return and wreak
  havoc.
- Experimental Awareness System
